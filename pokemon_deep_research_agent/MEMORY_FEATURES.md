# 🧠 POKEMON DEEP RESEARCH AGENT - MEMORY FEATURES

## 🎯 **NEW FEATURE: CONVERSATION MEMORY & FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS**

Your Pokemon Deep Research Agent now supports **conversation memory** and **follow-up questions**! This means the agent remembers what you've discussed and can provide contextual responses to follow-up queries.

## ✨ **KEY FEATURES**

### 🧠 **Conversation Memory**
- **Session-level memory** - Remembers everything within a conversation session
- **Context persistence** - Maintains Pokemon discussed, query types, and themes
- **Automatic context management** - No manual setup required

### 🔄 **Follow-up Question Support**
- **Context-aware responses** - References previous discussion
- **Smart Pokemon inference** - Understands "it", "them", "this Pokemon" references
- **Conversation continuity** - Builds on previous analysis

### 📚 **Conversation History**
- **Turn-by-turn tracking** - Every question and answer saved
- **Persistent storage** - Conversations saved to disk
- **Multiple sessions** - Isolated conversations with separate contexts

### 🎯 **Context-Aware Analysis**
- **Enhanced agent workflow** - 4-step process with memory integration
- **Smarter data collection** - Reuses context when appropriate
- **Contextual reporting** - Reports reference previous discussion

## 🚀 **USAGE EXAMPLES**

### **Example 1: Basic Follow-up**
```
User: "Tell me about Garchomp's competitive viability"
Agent: [Comprehensive Garchomp analysis]

User: "How does it compare to Dragonite?"
Agent: [Comparison using Garchomp context from previous turn]

User: "What about team synergies for both?"
Agent: [Team building advice for both Pokemon discussed]
```

### **Example 2: Context Inference**
```
User: "Tell me about Pikachu's competitive viability"
Agent: [Pikachu analysis]

User: "What about its evolved form?"
Agent: [Automatically infers Raichu and provides analysis]

User: "Can they work together on the same team?"
Agent: [Team synergy analysis for Pikachu and Raichu]
```

### **Example 3: Theme Continuation**
```
User: "What are the best Electric-type Pokemon?"
Agent: [Electric-type tier list and analysis]

User: "Which ones work well in rain teams?"
Agent: [Electric-types for rain teams, building on previous discussion]
```

## 🎮 **HOW TO USE**

### **Start Memory-Enabled Mode**
```bash
python interactive_demo_with_memory.py
```

### **Special Commands**
- `new session` - Start fresh conversation (clears memory)
- `summary` - Show conversation summary
- `clear` - Clear current session
- `quit` - Exit

### **Follow-up Question Tips**
- Use pronouns like "it", "them", "this Pokemon"
- Reference previous topics: "What about movesets?", "How do they compare?"
- Build on themes: "What about team synergies?", "In competitive play?"

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Conversation Context Manager**
```python
from src.core.conversation_memory import ConversationMemoryManager

# Automatic initialization
memory_manager = ConversationMemoryManager()

# Start new conversation
conv_id = memory_manager.start_new_conversation()

# Add conversation turns
memory_manager.add_turn(
    conversation_id=conv_id,
    user_input="Tell me about Garchomp",
    agent_response="Garchomp is...",
    pokemon_mentioned=["garchomp"],
    query_type="competitive"
)

# Get context for LLM
context = memory_manager.format_context_for_llm(conv_id)
```

### **Memory-Enhanced Agent Workflow**
1. **Context-Aware Query Analysis** - Analyzes query with conversation history
2. **Smart Data Collection** - Reuses context or fetches new data
3. **Context-Aware Analysis** - Performs analysis with memory integration
4. **Memory-Enhanced Reporting** - Generates contextual reports

### **Persistent Storage**
- Conversations saved to `data/conversations/`
- JSON format for easy inspection
- Automatic loading on startup
- Context isolation between conversations
