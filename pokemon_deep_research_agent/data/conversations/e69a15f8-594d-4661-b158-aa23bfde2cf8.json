Its robust base stats, particularly a high Attack (130) and solid Speed (102), paired with the Rough Skin ability, enable it to fulfill multiple offensive roles, predominantly as a physical sweeper and mixed attacker. While it is no longer the uncontested top-tier threat due to the prevalence of Fairy-type walls and bulky Water-types, Garchomp maintains a strong foothold in the OU tier and occasionally appears in UU under certain restrictions.\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive evaluation of Garchomp’s competitive viability, including in-depth analyses of its stats, abilities, roles, movesets, and counters, supported by precise numerical data and current meta-context. Actionable recommendations for team-building and gameplay strategy are included to optimize Garchomp’s utilization in competitive singles formats.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nGarchomp’s unique Dragon/Ground typing, combined with its pseudo-legendary base stat total of 600 (HP: 108, Atk: 130, Def: 95, SpA: 80, SpD: 85, Spe: 102), historically positioned it as a premier offensive threat. Despite evolving metagame dynamics and the rise of specialized counters, Garchomp’s blend of power, speed, and utility ensures its relevance. This report synthesizes Garchomp’s viability within the current OU metagame and outlines strategies to maximize its impact.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Tier Placement and Meta Viability\n\n- **Tier Placement:**  \n  Garchomp is firmly established in the OU tier, with occasional UU usage depending on tier shifts. It is not a dominant Uber threat but competes effectively against many top OU Pokémon.\n\n- **Meta Context:**  \n  The current meta features numerous bulky Fairy-types (e.g., Clefable, Togekiss) and Water-types (e.g., Toxapex, Slowbro) that challenge Garchomp’s offensive momentum. However, Garchomp’s speed advantage and diverse moveset options allow it to pressure and dismantle many defensive cores when properly supported.\n\n- **Usage Statistics:**  \n  Usage rates typically range between 5-10% in OU ladder play, reflecting consistent but not overwhelming popularity.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Stat Distribution and Impact on Role Viability\n\n| **Stat**         | **Base Value** | **Role Implication**                                         | **Common EV Spread Examples**                                                                 |\n|------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| HP               | 108            | Provides above-average bulk for a physical sweeper           | 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe (max offense), 252 HP / 4 Atk / 252 Spe (mixed bulk)                 |\n| Attack           | 130            | Elite physical offensive capability                           | 252 Atk for maximum damage output                                                             |\n| Defense          | 95             | Good physical bulk, enabling some defensive investment        | 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Atk for bulky physical sets                                              |\n| Special Attack   | 80             | Supports mixed sets with surprise special attacks             | 4 SpA for Fire Blast or Dragon Pulse in mixed sets                                            |\n| Special Defense  | 85             | Decent special bulk, allowing semi-bulky special builds       | 252 HP / 252 SpD / 4 Atk in rare bulky special attacker sets                                  |\n| Speed            | 102            | Fast enough to outspeed many meta threats                     | 252 Spe with Jolly nature to outspeed key threats such as Landorus-Therian and Hawlucha       |\n\n**Speed Calculations (Level 50 Standard):**  \n- Jolly (+Spe, -SpA) with 252 EVs yields 334 Speed, allowing outspeeding of Landorus-T (base 91, ~293 Speed) and many offensive threats.\n\n**Attack Output Estimation:**  \n- With 252 Atk EVs and Choice Band (+50% Atk) or a Swords Dance boost (+100%), Garchomp’s Attack can reach approximately 394–440 (level 50 scale), facilitating powerful Earthquake, Outrage, and Dragon Claw hits capable of breaking most defensive cores.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Typing and Ability Analysis\n\n### Typing: Dragon/Ground\n\n- **Strengths:**  \n  - Immunity to Electric-type attacks (key advantage over many Ground-types).  \n  - Strong STAB moves: Earthquake and Dragon-type attacks provide excellent coverage.  \n  - Effective against Fire, Rock, and Steel-types.\n\n- **Weaknesses:**  \n  - Quadruple weakness to Ice-type moves, making Ice-type Pokémon and Ice Beam users significant threats.  \n  - 2× weakness to Fairy and Dragon moves, which are prevalent in the meta.  \n  - 2× weakness to Water-type moves, requiring team support.\n\n### Abilities\n\n| Ability           | Competitive Viability                                   | Notes                                           |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| **Rough Skin**    | Preferred ability in nearly all competitive sets       | Deals 1/8 max HP damage to physical contact attackers, synergizes well with Garchomp’s role as a physical attacker. |\n| **Sand Veil**     | Niche, generally not recommended                        | 20% evasion boost in Sandstorm; unreliable and situational with fewer Sandstorm teams currently. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Common Roles and Movesets\n\n### 5.1 Physical Sweeper (Choice Scarf)\n\n- **Item:** Choice Scarf  \n- **Nature:** Jolly (+Spe, -SpA)  \n- **EVs:** 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe  \n- **Moves:** Earthquake, Outrage/Dragon Claw, Stone Edge, Fire Blast/Poison Jab  \n- **Strategy:**  \n  Outspeeds key threats and revenge kills weakened opponents. Outrage delivers massive damage but risks confusion lock; Dragon Claw provides safer Dragon STAB. Fire Blast or Poison Jab covers Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Togekiss.\n\n### 5.2 Swords Dance Sweeper\n\n- **Item:** Life Orb or Focus Sash  \n- **Nature:** Jolly or Adamant (+Atk, +Spe)  \n- **EVs:** 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe  \n- **Moves:** Swords Dance, Earthquake, Dragon Claw/Outrage, Fire Fang/Stone Edge  \n- **Strategy:**  \n  Sets up a Swords Dance to double Attack, then sweeps. Life Orb boosts damage at the cost of HP, whereas Focus Sash ensures survival for setup.\n\n### 5.3 Mixed Attacker\n\n- **Item:** Life Orb  \n- **Nature:** Naive (+Spe, -SpD) or Hasty (+Spe, -Def)  \n- **EVs:** 4 HP / 252 Atk / 252 Spe (or mixed bulk variants)  \n- **Moves:** Earthquake, Dragon Pulse, Fire Blast, Stone Edge  \n- **Strategy:**  \n  Uses special moves like Dragon Pulse to surprise specially defensive walls; Fire Blast targets Steel-types; Stone Edge handles Flying-type threats.\n\n### 5.4 Utility / Stealth Rock Setter\n\n- **Item:** Leftovers  \n- **Nature:** Impish (+Def, -SpA)  \n- **EVs:** 252 HP / 252 Def / 4 Atk  \n- **Moves:** Stealth Rock, Earthquake, Dragon Tail, Swords Dance  \n- **Strategy:**  \n  Provides hazard support and phases opponents with Dragon Tail. Less common but valuable in specific team compositions requiring hazard control.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Counters and Checks\n\n| Counter Type             | Representative Pokémon/Threats                      | Explanation                                                   |\n|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Ice-type Attackers**   | Weavile, Mamoswine, Kyurem, Ice Beam users        | Exploit Garchomp’s 4× weakness to Ice-type moves; threaten OHKOs |\n| **Bulky Fairy-types**    | Clefable, Togekiss                                 | Resist Garchomp’s STAB moves and can heal or stall           |\n| **Bulky Water-types**    | Toxapex, Slowbro, Gastrodon                        | Resist Earthquake and can absorb hits; stall or cripple Garchomp|\n| **Specially Defensive Dragons** | Dragonite (Multiscale), Hydreigon          | Resist physical attacks and hit back with special moves      |\n| **Priority Users**        | Azumarill (Aqua Jet), Scizor (Bullet Punch)       | Outspeed and threaten Garchomp, especially if weakened       |\n| **Status Conditions**     | Toxic, Will-O-Wisp users                           | Status moves reduce Garchomp’s offensive capabilities        |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Data-Driven Insights\n\n- **Speed Benchmarking:**  \n  At 334 Speed (Jolly, 252 Spe EVs), Garchomp outspeeds Landorus-Therian (~293 Speed), a key meta threat, allowing it to act as an effective revenge killer.\n\n- **Attack Output:**  \n  With 252 Atk EVs and Choice Band, Earthquake deals approximately 86–102% damage to 252 HP / 252 Def Toxapex, threatening reliable OHKOs or forcing switches.\n\n- **Ability Impact:**  \n  Rough Skin contributes incremental chip damage equivalent to 12.5% of the attacker’s max HP per contact, which accumulates over the course of matches, pressuring physical attackers.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Actionable Recommendations\n\n- **Team Construction:**  \n  - Pair Garchomp with Pokémon that can handle Ice-type moves (e.g., bulky Fire-types, Flying-types immune to Ground moves).  \n  - Incorporate hazard removal and status healing to mitigate chip damage and status effects that hinder Garchomp’s sweeping potential.  \n  - Use Garchomp as a mid-game cleaner after softening opponents with hazards and status conditions.\n\n- **Moveset Selection:**  \n  - Opt for Rough Skin as the preferred ability.  \n  - Choose movesets aligned with your team’s needs: Choice Scarf for speed control, Swords Dance for late-game sweeping, or mixed sets for unpredictability.  \n  - Consider Fire Blast or Poison Jab to handle common Steel-type walls effectively.\n\n- **In-Game Strategy:**  \n  - Avoid direct switches into Ice-type attackers and Fairy-type walls without prior damage or support.  \n  - Utilize Garchomp’s bulk to safely set up Swords Dance or hazards when appropriate.  \n  - Exploit Garchomp’s typing immunities (Electric immunity) to switch in on predicted Electric attacks.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Conclusion\n\nGarchomp remains a versatile and potent offensive Pokémon in the 2024 competitive singles environment. Its combination of high Attack and Speed, robust bulk, and Rough Skin ability enable it to fulfill various roles—from revenge killer to setup sweeper and hazard setter. While it faces notable counters, strategic team support and tailored movesets can mitigate these weaknesses and maximize Garchomp’s utility. Competitive players seeking a reliable physical or mixed attacker will find Garchomp a valuable asset in OU-level play.\n\n---\n\n*End of Report*  \n*Prepared by:* Professional Pokémon Research Division  \n*Contact:* research@pokedomain.org\n\n---",
