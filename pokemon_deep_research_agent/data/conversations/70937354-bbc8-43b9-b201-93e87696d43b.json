With an outstanding base Attack of 130, solid bulk (108 HP, 95 Defense, 85 Special Defense), and a high base Speed of 102, Garchomp excels as a physical sweeper and offensive pivot. Its typing grants immunity to Electric attacks and strong offensive coverage, complemented by the Rough Skin ability, which punishes contact moves. Despite facing notable threats from Fairy-types, Ice-type moves (which hit it 4x super effectively), and faster opponents, Garchomp consistently ranks in OverUsed (OU) tiers due to its adaptability, power, and synergy within balanced and hyper-offensive teams. This report provides a detailed, data-driven analysis of Garchomp’s competitive viability, roles, strengths, weaknesses, and team synergy, concluding with actionable recommendations for competitive players.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Overview and Tier Placement\n\n- **Pokémon:** Garchomp (#445)\n- **Typing:** Dragon / Ground\n- **Base Stats:** HP 108 / Atk 130 / Def 95 / SpA 80 / SpD 85 / Spe 102\n- **Abilities:** Rough Skin (primary), Sand Veil (hidden)\n- **Competitive Tier:** Predominantly OU; occasionally UU depending on metagame shifts\n- **Battle Format:** Singles (general competitive environment)\n\nGarchomp has maintained a strong presence in OU since its introduction, valued for its offensive pressure and respectable bulk. While it does not dominate the metagame, it reliably functions as a key offensive pivot, blending speed, power, and survivability.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Detailed Statistical Analysis\n\n| Stat             | Base Value | Competitive Implication                                   |\n|------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| HP               | 108        | Above-average bulk allows Garchomp to survive neutral hits and status effects better than many offensive Pokémon. |\n| Attack           | 130        | Elite physical attacker; enables 2HKO or better against many common threats with STAB moves. |\n| Defense          | 95         | Decent physical defense helps it survive physical hits better than pure glass cannons. |\n| Special Attack   | 80         | Moderate and rarely utilized; special moves like Dragon Pulse or Fire Blast are situational. |\n| Special Defense  | 85         | Provides solid special bulk, though still vulnerable to strong special attackers. |\n| Speed            | 102        | High speed tier; outruns many threats but can be outsped by faster threats (Dragapult, Choice Scarf users). |\n\n**EV and Nature Optimization:**  \n- Typical EV spread: 252 Attack / 252 Speed / 4 HP to maximize offensive output and speed.  \n- Nature: Jolly (+Speed, –SpA) or Adamant (+Attack, –SpA), balancing between speed control and raw damage.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Typing, Abilities, and Their Impact\n\n### Typing Advantages and Weaknesses\n\n- **Strengths:**  \n  - Immunity to Electric attacks (Ground-type).  \n  - Strong offensive STAB coverage with Earthquake and Dragon-type moves.  \n  - Effective against Steel, Fire, Rock, and Electric types.\n\n- **Weaknesses:**  \n  - 4× weakness to Ice-type moves (a critical vulnerability exploited by common Ice attackers).  \n  - 2× weakness to Dragon and Fairy moves; Fairy-types are prevalent in the metagame.  \n  - Vulnerable to status conditions, particularly burn and toxic.\n\n### Ability Analysis\n\n| Ability      | Effect                                                      | Competitive Merit                          |\n|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Rough Skin   | Inflicts 1/8 max HP damage to foes making contact           | Preferred; provides passive chip damage and punishes physical attackers. |\n| Sand Veil    | Raises evasion by 20% during sandstorm                      | Situational; evasion boosts are unreliable and risky due to RNG. |\n\nRough Skin synergizes well with Garchomp’s role as a physical attacker, adding residual damage that can turn the tide in long battles. Sand Veil is niche and mostly used in sandstorm teams but is less consistent competitively.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Role and Strategy Analysis\n\n### Primary Roles\n\n- **Physical Sweeper:**  \n  Garchomp’s high Attack and Speed make it an ideal late-game cleaner or mid-game breaker. It can use Swords Dance to boost its Attack, enabling it to break through defensive cores.\n\n- **Offensive Pivot:**  \n  With great bulk and typing, Garchomp can switch into certain attacks, forcing opponent switches and gaining momentum.\n\n### Secondary Roles\n\n- **Setup Sweeper:**  \n  Utilizing Swords Dance to leverage its strong Attack stat.\n\n- **Revenge Killer:**  \n  Outspeeds and finishes off weakened threats using priority moves like Sucker Punch or Ice Shard, though Ice Shard is more common on its Mega evolution or certain sets.\n\n- **Utility Support (less common):**  \n  Moves like Dragon Tail for phasing or Toxic for passive damage.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Common Movesets and Their Applications\n\n### A. Physical Swords Dance Sweeper\n\n| Move 1       | Earthquake (STAB Ground)                                  |\n|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Move 2       | Outrage / Dragon Claw (STAB Dragon)                       |\n| Move 3       | Fire Fang / Stone Edge (coverage)                         |\n| Move 4       | Swords Dance (setup)                                      |\n\n- **EVs:** 252 Atk / 252 Spe / 4 HP  \n- **Nature:** Jolly or Adamant  \n- **Strategy:** Boost Attack and sweep. Earthquake provides reliable 100 base power STAB. Outrage hits hard but locks the user into the move for 2-3 turns; Dragon Claw is safer but weaker. Fire Fang or Stone Edge cover Steel, Ice, and Flying types.\n\n### B. Choice Scarf Attacker\n\n| Move 1       | Earthquake                                               |\n|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Move 2       | Outrage / Dragon Claw                                    |\n| Move 3       | Fire Blast (special coverage) / Stone Edge              |\n| Move 4       | N/A (locked by Choice Scarf)                             |\n\n- **EVs:** 252 Atk / 252 Spe / 4 HP  \n- **Nature:** Jolly  \n- **Strategy:** Outspeed and hit hard; especially effective against faster threats and revenge kills. Fire Blast sacrifices physical bulk for coverage against Steel-types.\n\n### C. Tanky Offensive Pivot\n\n| Move 1       | Earthquake                                               |\n|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Move 2       | Dragon Tail (phasing)                                    |\n| Move 3       | Fire Fang / Toxic / Stealth Rock (utility options)       |\n| Move 4       | Swords Dance / Stone Edge                                |\n\n- **EVs:** Balanced HP and defenses (e.g., 252 HP / 128 Def / 128 Spe)  \n- **Nature:** Impish or Jolly  \n- **Strategy:** Mix of offense and utility to wear down opponents, pivot, and provide team support.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Counters, Checks, and Threats\n\n| Threat Category         | Examples                                       | Reasoning                                         |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Fairy-type Pokémon     | Magearna, Togekiss, Tapu Fini, Mega Mawile    | Resist Dragon STAB; threaten with powerful Fairy moves. |\n| Ice-type Moves / Pokémon | Weavile, Mamoswine, Ice Beam variants         | 4× weakness to Ice-type moves; Ice Shard priority is particularly dangerous. |\n| Faster Physical Attackers | Dragapult, Cinderace, Choice Scarf users      | Outspeed and KO Garchomp before it can act.      |\n| Bulky Steel-types      | Ferrothorn, Corviknight                        | Wall Garchomp’s attacks and spread status or residual damage. |\n| Status Conditions      | Burn, Toxic                                    | Severely reduce Garchomp’s offensive viability.  |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Synergy and Team Support Considerations\n\n- **Stealth Rock:**  \n  Entry hazards chip away at Fairy-types and other bulky foes, easing Garchomp’s offensive pressure.\n\n- **Fairy Counters:**  \n  Teammates like Heatran (resists Fairy moves), Corviknight (bulk and Defog), and specially defensive Pokémon help keep Fairy threats in check.\n\n- **Status Healers / Clerics:**  \n  Pokémon that can remove burn or toxic status (e.g., Aromatisse, Cleric Pokémon) extend Garchomp’s longevity.\n\n- **Sandstorm Teams:**  \n  While Sand Veil is rarely used, Garchomp can fit into sandstorm teams utilizing synergy with Tyranitar or Hippowdon, but this requires careful team composition.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Data-Driven Insights\n\n- **Damage Output:**  \n  - 252 Atk Garchomp Earthquake vs. 252 HP / 4 Def Ferrothorn: approx. 50-60% damage.  \n  - 252 Atk Garchomp Outrage vs. 252 HP / 4 Def Corviknight: approx. 70-85% damage.  \n- **Speed Comparison:**  \n  - Garchomp outspeeds base 100 Speed Pokémon (e.g., Landorus-T) but is outsped by base 120+ threats like Dragapult.  \n- **Ability Impact:**  \n  -",
