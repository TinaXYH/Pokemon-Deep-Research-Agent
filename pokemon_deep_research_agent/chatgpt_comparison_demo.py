Pokemon Deep Research Agent vs ChatGPT Comparison Demo

This script demonstrates how our specialized multi-agent system provides
more comprehensive, accurate, and helpful Pokemon research compared to
simply asking ChatGPT directly.

Key Advantages Demonstrated:
1. Real-time Pokemon data integration (vs ChatGPT's training cutoff)
2. Specialized competitive analysis framework
3. Multi-agent workflow with domain expertise
4. Conversation memory and context awareness
5. Structured research methodology
6. Professional-grade reporting format
